## Known UI limitations for Windows Server task manager, WMI, or PowerShell queries to pull CPU information

- Task Manager does not display L2 and L3 cache sizes, or displays incorrect L2 and L3 cache sizes.

    For example, see the following figure.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/windows-server-support-installation-for-amd-role-family-processor/screenshot-of-l2-l3-cache-size.jpg" alt-text="L2 and L3 cache display issue.":::

- Task Manager displays an incorrect number of sockets.

    For example, for a single-CPU one-socket system, Task Manager displays two sockets. For a two-socket system, Task Manager displays four sockets.

- Task manager displays an incorrect number of Numa nodes.

    For example, for a one-socket system, Task Manager displays two Numa nodes. For a two-socket system, Task Manager displays four Numa nodes.
